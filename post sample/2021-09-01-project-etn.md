## Project Goal
The final objective of this project is to propose a networking system which can guarantee not only existing network services but also Ultra-Low Latency (ULL).<br/>
&emsp;- To construct TSN/DetNet-based networking system<br/>
&emsp;- To develop traffic management to guarantee bounded network latency<br/>


## Research Methodology
